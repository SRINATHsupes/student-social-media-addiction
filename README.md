# student-social-media-addiction
Dash app analyzing student social media addiction data
This project analyzes social media addiction among students using interactive data visualizations and dashboards built with **Dash (Plotly)**, **Folium**, and **Pandas**. It aims to explore patterns, behaviors, and impacts of social media usage on studentsâ€™ daily lives and mental health.
With the increasing use of social media, especially among students, it's crucial to understand:
- How much time is spent daily?
- Which platforms are most addictive?
- Are there correlations with sleep, stress, or academics?

This dashboard gives a **visual story** of survey data collected from students on their social media usage and its effects.
FEATURES 
> Interactive **Dash** dashboard  
> **Bar charts**, **Pie charts**, and other visualizations (Plotly)  
> **World map** showing geographical data using **Folium**  
> Clean layout with multiple graphs side-by-side  
> Real-time data visualization experience

The project includes a `folium` map to visualize:
- Locations of survey responses (if geolocation included)
- Hotspots of high social media usage
- Optional popups with student behavior summaries

> The map is saved as an HTML file and embedded in the Dash app or linked separately.
